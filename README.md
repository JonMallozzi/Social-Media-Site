# Social Media Site - name TBD

## Goal 
#### The goal is to make a site that is a portal to a clean new web. One without bloated apps and too much JavaScript. In all I just hope to make a friendlier and safer web to free us from our tech overlords, data tracking, security flaws, and the depressing hate on the major web apps like twitter and facebook

## Idea
#### The idea for the site is for it to be a portal to all kinds of pages where each page is a high performance web app that is open source with a shared account that can be used across all pages/apps.One day when I figure out how safely allow it, I would love for users to be able to simply make their own apps for the site. 

## Current App Ideas
* Email App - gmail but good and no datatracking. For the desktop, web, cli
  and mobile
* Chat app - Whats App but with actual encrypted messaging. Think signal
  or telegram but like discord but better and no electron. For the desktop, web, cli and mobile. 
* Password manager - lastpass but free. For the Web, cli, and Mobile
* Google Auth - not google and free. For the Web, Cli, and Mobile
* Google Drive - not google but a place store and create documents. For
  desktop, web, cli, mobile
* Goal/Pomodoro App - a little goal tracking and pomodoro timer game
* Facebook clone - share images, videos, chat and hang out with friends
  but not have deal with all the facebook bullshit. For Web and mobile
* Web games I create
* Many more as they get suggested or thought of 

## Webrowser
#### In the end I hope to make a webrowser for desktop and mobile browser to view all of the pages in one central place instead of having to download a bunch of apps. I.e just have one browser app on your phone instead of one for the chat service and one for the email service

## Tech Stack
* PostgresDB
* Actix Rust For Backend 
* Yew Rust for Webpages
* Rust for cli, dekstop, and most mobile apps
